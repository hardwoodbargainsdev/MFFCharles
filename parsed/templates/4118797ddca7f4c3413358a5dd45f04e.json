You pay $10 a month and save 20% on all of your MFF purchases and can cancel any time you want.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"faq-toggles\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"section\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"ob-heading-sm\">IS THIS A CONTRACT?</h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is not a contract.  We don't like contracts.  Pay as you go, stop anytime you'd like. xoxo</p>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"faq-toggles\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"section\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"ob-heading-sm\">IS THERE A MONTHLY LIMIT ON SAVINGS?</h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Nope. We don’t cap your monthly spend or once you reach a certain amount of savings because that would just not be cool.
